# Agento CSV and OTEL for Lake Merritt

In this version of Agento multi-agent multi-module system, we will generate data that can be reviewed even better by the Lake Merritt evals platform.  

We plan to:

1) Emit CSV Data that fills the expected 3-column format
2) Emit OpenTelemetry as a JSON file that can be ingested using an Eval Pack
3) Emit OpenTelemetry streaming data that can be evaluated on the fly

If a HyperDomo happens to wander into the mix, it's completely understandable.  Under the circumstances.
