This report will analyze key legal precedents and ethics opinions (e.g., ABA Formal Opinion 477R) concerning lawyers' use of cloud technology. It will define the concepts of 'reasonable expectation of privacy,' 'waiver of privilege,' and the role of a third-party provider in maintaining confidentiality.
